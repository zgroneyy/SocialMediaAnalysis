% We use COSFIRE filters [2] to form a face descriptor and use it for gender 
% recognition. COSFIRE filters are trainable shape detectors. The term trainable 
% refers to the ability of determining their selectivity in an automatic 
% configuration process that analyses a given prototype pattern of interest 
% in terms of its dominant orientations and their mutual spatial arrangement. 
% Our hypothesis is that by configuring multiple COSFIRE filters, that are 
% selective for different parts of the faces, we can capture the subtle 
% differences that distinguish the faces of men and women. 
%
% The steps for the recognition of the gender are the following:
% - First we apply the Viola-Jones algorithm to the image and resize the 
%   detected face to a fixed size of 128 by 128 pixels.
% - Then we apply a set of COSFIRE filters that we learned from training 
%   images and use their responses to compute a descriptor of the face. For 
%   more details about the configuration procedure and the response computation 
%   we refer the reader to [1].
% - Finally we recognize the gender of a person using an SVM classification 
%   model with a Chi-squared kernel, that is more appropriate than other types 
%   of kernel since we are dealing with histograms.
%
% We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on 
% the GENDER-FERET dataset and achieve an accuracy rate of ~94%. 
% 
% Example 1: 
%   result = Gender_recognition_with_COSFIRE(90, './GENDER-FERET/', 1, 128); 
%
% The above code runs an experiment to recognize the gender of the people in the test set
% of the GENDER-FERET dataset. The 180 filters (90 from female images and 90 from male 
% images) are configured and selected using the training set of the GENDER-FERET dataset. 
% For more details we refer the reader to [1]. 
%
% Input parameters:
% - noperatorspergender: number of COSFIRE filters to use for each gender type. 
% - dataFolder: path of the dataset folder. If you don't want to modify the
%   code, you have to preserve the organization of the folder, with the
%   sub-folders 'male' and 'female' in the first level and the sub-folders
%   'training' and 'test' in the second level.
% - doFaceDetection: if 1, it performs face detection using the Viola-Jones
%   algorithm. Otherwise, it considers the full image as a face.
% - resizeWidth: If resizeWidth is set NaN then the face images are not resized, otherwise they are resized to
%   [resizeWidth, resizeWidth].
%   hep female, ilk yarý 1 ikinci yarý 0
%   1ler false
%   önce male kontrol ediliyor
%   2714 female test baþlangýç
%   8062 male test baþlangýç
